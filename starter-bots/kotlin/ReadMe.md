# Kotlin Sample Bot

Kotlin is a statically typed programming language that runs on the Java virtual machine. It is 100% interoperable with Java, but was built to be more expressive, concise and safer.

## Learn Kotlin

The official documentation and tutorials can be found https://kotlinlang.org/


## Environment Setup

Install the [Java Development Kit](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) and [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)

## Compilation

The bot can be built using Maven:

`mvn clean package` compiles the bot and packages it to a jar file. 

## Running
The bot can be run like any other jar. 

For example: `java -jar kotlin-sample-bot.jar`
