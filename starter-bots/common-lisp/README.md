# Common Lisp sample bot

Lisp is a homoiconic language that was there from the beginning and
still has a fresh perspective to offer.

## Environment requirements

Install SBCL common lisp compiler and make sure it's on your path.

Install [QuickLisp](https://www.quicklisp.org/beta/#installation) and add quicklisp to your SBCL init file (by running `(ql:add-to-init-file)` after loading quicklisp.lisp in SBCL).
