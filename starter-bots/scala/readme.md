# Scala Sample Bot

A simple starter bot using Functional Scala.

## Dependencies

The bot requires `sbt` for dependency management, as well as the Java runtime environment to be run.

## Running

The game runner will compile using the `sbt package` command.  For example:

```
sbt package
```

This generates the jar file, which can be run using the java runtime environment, example:

```
java -jar entelect-scala-bot_2.12-0.1.jar
```
